# Content/Deletion

In the previous step, we mentioned that to complete the deletion, we need to first move the last element of the *array* to the element at index ***i***, and then delete the last element of the *array*.

We have already completed the moving operation, and now we need to delete the last element of the *array*, which can be done using the `pop` statement.

    ```solidity
    arr.pop();
    ```
