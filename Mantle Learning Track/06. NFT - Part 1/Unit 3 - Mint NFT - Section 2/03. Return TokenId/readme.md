# Content/Return TokenId

The last step we need to do is to return the TokenId of the newly created token.

Why are we doing this? We want to notify the owner of the **id** of their newly minted NFT, and this also serves as a check on the ownerâ€™s side. 

Is my ***mint*** *function* working correctly? If we *return* them some value greater than 0, this means that their NFT is **minted correctly**. 

**Syntax**

return

- hint
    
    ```solidity
    function hello() returns(int){
      return 10 - 3;
    }
    ```
