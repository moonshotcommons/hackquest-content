# Content/Define compiler Version

The first thing we need to do with an empty Solidity file is define the *compiler* version. Without this definition, the compiler cannot compile the code correctly, and nothing could be done. 

This version number is significant because different *compiler* versions may introduce changes, updates, or bug fixes.

Here, we use *compiler* version *0.8.17*.

    pragma solidity 0.8.17;
