# Content/Define Constructor

Let's do the second thing: define the constructor.

The constructor **is a special function in a *contract* that is automatically executed during *contract* deployment. It is used to initialize *variables* and set up the *contract's* initial **state.

Once the *constructor* is executed during deployment, it cannot be called again.

**Syntax**

constructor

- Hint
    
    ```solidity
    constructor() {}
    ```
