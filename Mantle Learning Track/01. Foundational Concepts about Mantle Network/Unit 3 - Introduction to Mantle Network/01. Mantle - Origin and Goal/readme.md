# 6. Mantle - Origin and Goal

# Content/Content

### Objectives

The objective of this section is to learn about the origin and objectives of the Mantle Network.

### Introduction

Mantle is incubated by BitDAO, a well-known decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) with substantial financial resources. BitDAO was founded in 2021 by Bybit, a prominent cryptocurrency exchange based in Singapore. With a treasury holding over $3 billion, BitDAO provides Mantle with ample funding and technical support.

Mantle Network aimed to build a Layer2 solution that could support various application scenarios. They approached Alice for insights into the technical implementation and realized that while a simple transfer application would be relatively straightforward, supporting multiple application scenarios would be highly complex. They understood that any small flaw during development could undermine all their efforts.

Consequently, the Mantle team decided to build their solution based on the Optimistic Rollup technology. Simultaneously, they adopted EigenDA developed by EigenLayer, offering advanced data availability solutions. They also incorporated Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and a more decentralized Sequencer, which increased transaction throughput, reduced transaction fees, and enhanced network security and scalability.

At this point, you might be feeling a little bit overwhelmed. Don't worry; you will learn about these new terms in the upcoming tutorials. 

Mantle's objective is to bring higher performance, lower costs, enhanced security, and decentralization to the Ethereum ecosystem through their technological innovations and robust ecosystem support. 

### Next lesson

In the next lesson, we will provide a high-level overview of the system architecture of the Mantle Network.
