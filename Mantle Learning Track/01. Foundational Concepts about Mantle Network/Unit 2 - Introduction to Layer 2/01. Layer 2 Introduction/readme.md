### Objective

The goal of this section is to learn:

- What is Layer 2?
- Why do we need Layer 2?

### Fundamentals of Blockchain Technology

Before introducing Mantle, let's familiarize ourselves with some basic concepts of blockchain.
Blockchain is a distributed ledger that links transaction records in the form of blocks and ensures data security and consistency through decentralized consensus algorithms.

The most well-known application of blockchain is Bitcoin, but it can also be applied to various other areas such as smart contracts and identity authentication.

The core characteristics of blockchain are decentralization and security.

- Decentralization means that there is no central authority controlling the entire system; instead, the data is maintained and verified by nodes in the network.
- Security is ensured through consensus algorithms and encryption techniques, making the data tamper-proof and resistant to malicious attacks.

### Why Do We Need Layer 2?

Layer 1 refers to the foundational layer of a blockchain, also known as the mainnet. Bitcoin and Ethereum are typical examples of Layer 1 blockchains.

However, conducting transactions and executing smart contracts on Layer 1 requires the participation of all network nodes, which poses challenges such as low throughput, high transaction fees, and high latency. These challenges are unfavorable for applications that require high performance and low costs, such as payments, gaming, and decentralized exchanges.

The emergence of Layer 2 aims to address these bottlenecks and challenges of Layer 1. By migrating a portion of transactions or computations to Layer 2, the system's throughput and performance can be significantly improved. Additionally, since Layer 2 does not require the participation of too many nodes, it can reduce transaction costs and latency. This makes blockchain more applicable to a wide range of practical use cases and can meet the needs of more users.

### Summary

In this tutorial, we have learned the basics of blockchain, including its characteristics of decentralization and security. We have also introduced the concepts of Layer 1 and Layer 2 and explained the need for Layer 2. Layer 2 helps address issues related to throughput, performance, and costs in blockchain, making blockchain more practical and scalable.
