# Content/Define the SimpleCryptoKitties contract

After importing the ERC721 *standard*, let's define our CryptoKitty *contract*.

As mentioned earlier, we will inherit the ERC721 *contract* we imported when defining our own *contract* here.

**Syntax** 

contract, inherit

- hint
    
    ```solidity
    contract CryptoKitties is ERC721 {}
    ```
