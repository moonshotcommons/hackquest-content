# Content/Query information of kittyâ€™s mom and dad

After defining the function, we need to retrieve the basic information of both the mom and dad kitties. This information is stored in the ***kitties*** *mapping*.

We can directly access the ***Kitty*** *struct* associated with the given ***momId*** and ***dadId***, from the ***kitties** mapping*.

In Solidity, when working with *structs*, we must specify the storage location. Since we don't intend to modify the information of the mom and dad kitties, we'll store them in `memory`. This approach will help in saving a significant amount of *gas*.

**Syntax**

    ```solidity
    //For example, here we gain the Student struct stored in the students mapping corresponding to the studentId
    Student memory a = students[studentId];
    ```
