# Content/**Creating the Project**

In the last lesson, we learned about Rust's package manager and build tool Cargo, including some *basic commands*: creating a project, compiling, and running a project. Now, we will officially learn how to use Cargo to *create* your first Rust project - ***Bulls and Cows***.

ðŸ’¡ Make sure you have installed Rust and Cargo as guided in the previous lesson.

### **Specific Steps**

1. Open the Command Line Tool
    
    This is the first step in starting any *Rust* project. Whether you are a **Windows**, **Linux**, or **macOS** user, find and open your command line tool.
    
2. Enter the Command to Create a Project
    
    Enter the following command in your terminal to create a new Rust project - ***Bulls and Cows***:
    
    ```bash
    cargo new bulls_and_cows
    ```
    
    > In Rust, project names are usually in **lowercase** and use **underscores** instead of **spaces** for consistency and compatibility. Thus, the descriptive name ***Bulls and Cows*** will be converted to ***bulls_and_cows*** when actually created.
    > 
3. Enter the Project Directory
    
    After creating the project, use the following command to enter the project directory:
    
    ```bash
    cd bulls_and_cows
    ```
    

### **Directory**

After creating the ***Bulls and Cows*** project, we enter the ***bulls_and_cows*** folder and can see the files and directories automatically generated by Cargo

```bash
$ tree
.
â”œâ”€â”€ .git
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â””â”€â”€ src
    â””â”€â”€ main.rs
```
