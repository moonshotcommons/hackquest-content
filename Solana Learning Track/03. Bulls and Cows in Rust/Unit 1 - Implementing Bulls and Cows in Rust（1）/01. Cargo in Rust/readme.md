# Content/**What is Cargo**

Cargo is the package manager and build system for the Rust programming language. 

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Just as you need tools and materials to build a building, Cargo provides all the tools and libraries you need for Rust project development.

Cargo helps you from creating a project, downloading project dependencies, compiling code, building, and testing, to finally running and deploying your project.

### **How to Install Cargo**

- If we have already installed Rust, Cargo will be installed along with it, so there's no need for additional installation.
- If you haven't installed the Rust environment yet, you can follow these tutorials for installation: **[Install Rust](https://course.rs/first-try/installation.html#%E5%AE%89%E8%A3%85-rust)** or **[Rust Install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)**

### **Related Commands**

Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned developer, Cargo will be an indispensable tool in your Rust development. Of course, if you're not familiar with it, don't worry. Next, let's learn about Cargo's related commands.

- basic commands
    
    ```bash
