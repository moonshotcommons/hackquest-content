# Content/Course Outline

ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You have completed the foundational learning on Solana NFT concepts! Now, we are about to embark on the practical coding journey with Solana!

In the upcoming sessions, we will systematically create and mint NFTs. We will start by creating the **Mint Account** corresponding to the NFT to generate the associated tokens. Next, we will create the **Metadata Account** to add additional data related to the NFT. Finally, we will create the **Master Edition Account** to manage the minting process of the NFTs.

Let's follow the tutorial together to implement this Solana project! ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
