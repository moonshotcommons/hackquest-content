# Content/ ****Master Edition Account

In the previous lesson, we learned about the **Metadata Account** of **Metaplex**, which allows us to associate NFT metadata with SPL Tokens. In this lesson, we will delve into another account in **Metaplex** called the **Master Edition Account**, which is used to manage the minting of NFTs.

**Master Edition Account**

As we've learned before, NFTs on Solana are essentially regular SPL Tokens with a fixed supply of 1. But what if an artist wants to release 100 copies of their artwork, each with a unique version number, essentially creating a limited edition 1/1 NFT? How can we achieve this?

To address this, **Metaplex** introduces the **Master Edition Account** to manage the minting of NFTs:

Similar to the initial **Mint Account**, the **Master Edition Account** is derived using the PDA method. Thus, if we know the SPL Token, we can determine its corresponding **Master Edition Account**.

It has two key attributes:

- **Supply**: The current supply, indicating the number of times the original NFT has been minted or duplicated.
- **Max Supply**: The maximum supply. Once the supply reaches the maximum, no more NFTs can be minted in this manner. However, note that if the **Max Supply** attribute of the **Master Edition** is set to null, it means that this NFT can be minted infinitely.

With this knowledge, we now have a basic understanding of Solana NFTs. Next, we will move on to the practical coding section where we will apply our acquired knowledge step by step to complete our NFT project. ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
