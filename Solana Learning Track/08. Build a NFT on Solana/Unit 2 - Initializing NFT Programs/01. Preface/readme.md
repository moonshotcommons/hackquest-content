# Content/Intro

Alright, we've officially embarked on our NFT journey on Solana!

In this opening chapter, we're going to start building the basic framework for our NFT program!

Setting up this foundation involves a few key steps:

1. Importing necessary libraries and dependencies. Think of these as the toolbox that makes our functionalities possible.
2. Declaring a unique identifier for our program. It's like giving our project its own one-of-a-kind name.
3. Laying out the program's framework. This is where we'll write our main logic code.

In this chapter, we'll focus on accomplishing the first two steps: importing the libraries and modules we need and setting a unique identifier for our NFT program. üöÄüõ†Ô∏è
