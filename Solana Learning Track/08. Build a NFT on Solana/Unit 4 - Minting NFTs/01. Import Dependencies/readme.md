# Content/Import Dependencies

Ready to start our NFT minting journey? ðŸš€Â ðŸš€Â  

First, we'll import the anchor_spl library. It's our key to interacting with the Solana Standard Program Library (SPL), simplifying token management and other functions.

1. **Begin by importing the `anchor_spl::token` module.**
    
    ```rust
    use anchor_spl::token;
    ```
    
    This module integrates Solana's token standards into our toolkit, equipping us for a range of token operations. It simplifies tasks such as creating, transferring, and querying tokens.
    
2. **Now, import the `MintTo` and `Token` structs from `anchor_spl::token`.**
    
    ```rust
    use anchor_spl::token::{MintTo, Token};
    ```
    
    Here's the breakdown:
    
    - ***MintTo*ï¼š** This is our tool for minting new tokens, a critical function in our NFT journey.
    - ***Token*ï¼š** Consider this as the core representation of a token in our code.
    
    Together, these structures form the backbone of our NFT minting code.
    

In the upcoming lessons, we're going to have some fun putting these imports to use. ðŸš€ Get ready to see how they power up our NFT minting skills! ðŸ’ªðŸŽ¨
