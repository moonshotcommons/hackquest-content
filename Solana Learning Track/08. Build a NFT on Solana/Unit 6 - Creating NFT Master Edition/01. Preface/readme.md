# Content/Preface

In the previous lessons, we introduced the Metaplex protocol and its **Token Metadata** program. This program's role is to add supplementary data to NFTs and forms the foundation of the entire Metaplex contract ecosystem.

In the last chapter, we learned about using **metadata PDAs (Program Derived Addresses)** to enhance our NFTs with details like ***name***, ***symbol***, ***uri***. Users, through their wallets connected to the ***metadata account*** created in the previous lesson, can display their NFTs.

This chapter focuses on creating a ***MasterEdition***. Building on the token we minted in Chapter 2, we will add an additional decoration PDA, known as ***MasterEdition*** (**the primary version**). This PDA signifies that we can continue to mint more copies based on the original NFT.

Are you ready? Let's continue our journey deeper into the exciting world of Solana NFT development!🚀✨🪐
