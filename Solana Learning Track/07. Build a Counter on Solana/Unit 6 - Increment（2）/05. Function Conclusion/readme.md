# Content/**Function Conclusion**

In the previous chapters, we have completed the core logic of the ***increment*** function, including *permission verification* and *incrementing the counter value*. Now, we have reached the final step of this *function*.

In the previous code, we already have a complete *function* example. Let's think about how to conclude the function.

**Syntax**

Ok

- hint
    
    ```rust
        pub fn increment(ctx: Context<Increment>) -> Result<()> {
           
            //....
    
            Ok(())
        }
    ```
