# Content/ Intro

ðŸŽ‰Â Hi! Next, we are about to enter the exciting project actual combat chapter! Let us first have an overview of our project!

### **Project Description**

The ***Counter*** is a simple and practical project. In this project, we will build a basic counter that can record and update values.

In previous chapters, we implemented a **native** Solana counter using Rust. In this section, we will combine the knowledge of the **Anchor** learned earlier to implement an *Anchor version of the counter*.
Through the implementation of this simple project, we will begin to initially explore how to develop on Solana!ðŸš€

In the following chapters, we will complete:

- Writing Counter code logic
- Deploy Counter to Solana local network
- Call the Counter program on the Solana chain through a script
