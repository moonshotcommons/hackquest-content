# Content/Define the function header

Next, let's start writing the *function*!

### **Defining the initialize Function**

1. **Declare the Function**:
    - We want this *function* to be *public*, meaning it can be called by users outside the *program* or by other *programs*.
    - We want the *function* to have access to all the data defined in the ***Initialize*** struct, so we need to pass the corresponding context as a parameter.
2. **Specify the Return Type**:
    
    Although we strive to perfect our code and minimize errors, the function might return success (`Ok(())`) or encounter an error (`Err(...)`**)**. Therefore, we can return a `()`, which indicates that our *function does not return any additional values upon success*.
    

**Syntax**

function

    ```rust
    pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> Result<()> {
        
    }
    ```
