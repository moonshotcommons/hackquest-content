# Content/**Function Conclusion**

In fact, in the previous lesson, we have already completed the initialization, and now we have reached the final step of this function.

In Solana's programs, functions typically end by returning a `ProgramResult`. This is a special result type used to indicate the success or failure of the function's execution.

To indicate to the caller that our function has successfully completed its task, we use `Ok(())`, which is actually a very concise way to express "everything went according to plan, with no errors occurring."

Here, `Ok` ****is a variant of the `Result` type, indicating success, and `()` is the empty tuple in Rust, signifying that there is no additional information or value to return.

Therefore, returning `Ok(())` at the end of the `initialize` function is like saying: "Okay, I have completed all tasks, everything is normal, and there are no errors.

```rust
Ok(())
```

**Syntax**

Ok

    ```rust
        pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> Result<()> {
           
            //....
    
            Ok(())
        }
    ```
