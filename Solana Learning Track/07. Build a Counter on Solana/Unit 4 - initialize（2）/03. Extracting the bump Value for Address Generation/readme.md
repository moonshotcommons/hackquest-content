Following the previous steps, the next thing to do is to obtain the *bump value* used for generating the account address. This is a key step in ensuring that our ***Counter*** account's address is both unique and secure.

1. **Extracting the Bump Value for Address Generation**ï¼š
    
    To obtain the *PDA bump value* associated with the ***Counter*** account, we can use the special field `ctx.bumps`.
    
    ```rust
    ctx.bumps.counter;
    ```
    
    <aside>
    ðŸ’¡ `ctx.bumps` is used to store the bump values of all Program Derived Addresses (PDA) used in the contract call.

Through these two lessons, we have not only prepared the capability to modify the ***Counter*** account but also ensured the uniqueness and security of its address.

**Syntax**

ctx.bumps

- hint
    
    ```rust
    let bump = ctx.bumps.counter;
    ```
