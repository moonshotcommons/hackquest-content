# Content/**Obtaining Current Time**

Starting from this lesson, we will learn *how to generate a random number* for the guessing game. To simplify the logic, we will obtain the *current time* from the Solana program library and use this time to generate a random number.

**Defining the Random Number Function**

First, we need to define the function for generating the random number. The function will return a **`u32`** type integer, which will be the generated random number:

```rust
fn generate_number() -> u32 {
	
}
```

**Syntax**

fn

- hint
    
    ```rust
    fn generate_random_number() -> u32 {
    	
    }
    ```
