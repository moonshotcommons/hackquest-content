# Content/**Using declare_id**

In this lesson, we will learn how to declare a *unique ID* for our Solana program.

> On Solana, each program has a **unique address**, known as the **program ID (programId)**. This ID serves as a unique identifier for the program on the chain, making it easy to locate your program.
> 

**Using the declare_id! Macro**

In the Anchor framework, we use the `declare_id!` macro to specify the on-chain address of the program. When you first build an Anchor program, the framework generates a new key pair. The *public key* of this key pair becomes your program ID.

```rust
declare_id!("Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS");
```

**Important Notes**

- During the development phase, you can use any value as the program ID, such as the *Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS* used in the example code above.
- When the program is ready to be deployed to the Solana network, you should use the *public key* of the new key pair generated by the *Anchor* framework as the *program ID*.
