Firstly, the initial step in setting up our program is *importing dependencies*. In this lesson, we will learn how to correctly import the necessary libraries and modules, ensuring we have the right tools to write and run our code.

This course will utilize the powerful *Anchor* framework for development. Therefore, the primary step is to import the ***anchor_lang*** library, which provides us with the core functionalities and type definitions of the *Anchor* framework.

**Importing the prelude module of anchor_lang**

```rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;
```

The ***prelude*** module contains key modules and functions of *Anchor* that we will need for our subsequent development.

Alright, we have completed importing the *Anchor* dependencies. In the next lesson, we will continue learning about program initialization.

**Syntax**

- hint
    
    ```rust
    use anchor_spl::token;
    ```
