# Content/Intro

ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ Hi! Congratulations on completing the foundational *Solana* and *Anchor* framework lessons! Now, we're about to dive into the exciting practical application of Solana!

### **Project Overview**

In the previous courses, we completed a number guessing game written in Rust. Next, we're going to implement a guessing game that runs on Solana, which will also include how to generate random numbers and handle player guesses.

Let's follow the tutorial and implement this fun game together! ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
