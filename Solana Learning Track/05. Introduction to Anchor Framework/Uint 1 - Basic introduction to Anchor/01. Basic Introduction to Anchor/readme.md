In the upcoming lessons, we will learn about an important framework for developing Solana programs (smart contracts) - Anchor ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

### Introduction to Anchor

Anchor is a framework for **rapidly** and **securely** building Solana programs. It generates a lot of boilerplate code, such as (de)serialization of accounts and instruction data, allowing you to focus more on the development of business logic. Additionally, it performs specific security checks, account verification, and supports easy implementation of custom checks.

Anchor also provides a set of libraries and tools for frontend projects, simplifying the complexity of interacting with on-chain programs. It offers support for Program Derived Account (PDA) and Cross-Program Invocations (CPI).

In summary, Anchor empowers developers to more easily build, deploy, and maintain their decentralized applications on the Solana blockchain.
