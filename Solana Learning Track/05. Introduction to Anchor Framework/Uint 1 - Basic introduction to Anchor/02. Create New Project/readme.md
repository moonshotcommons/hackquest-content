In the previous lesson, we learned that Anchor is a framework for building and deploying programs (smart contracts) on the Solana blockchain. It provides a set of tools and libraries to simplify the smart contract development process. Before we get started, we need to complete the installation process.

Anchor itself is a Solana development framework written in Rust, and it also supports frontend projects. Therefore, its installation involves a series of dependencies, such as `Rust`, `Solana`, `Yarn`. After installing the dependencies, we install the Anchor Version Manager (`avm`), which is similar to `nvm` for managing Node.js versions. Through `avm`, we can flexibly use and manage Anchor. ***[Installation guide can be found here](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation)***.

Next, let's explore the common commands for developing programs using the Anchor framework.

### Common Commands

1. **Initialize a New Project**: This command is used to create a new Anchor project, including demo code. You can replace ***my_project*** with your own project name.
    
    ```rust
    anchor init my_project
    ```
    
2. **Build a New Program (Smart Contract)**: This command is used to build and compile the program. It generates the compiled contract binary in the `target/deploy` directory. You can omit the project name if you are in the project directory.
    
    ```bash
    anchor build [my_project]
    ```
    
3. **Test Program Logic**: Running this command executes the program's test suite to ensure its functionality.
    
    ```bash
    anchor test
    ```
    
4. **Deploy Program to a Specified Network**: Solana's devnet is a network specifically designed for development and testing. Usually, we deploy the project locally or on the devnet for verification before deploying it to the mainnet mainnet-beta.
    
    ```rust
    anchor deploy --env devnet
    anchor deploy --env mainnet-beta
    ```
    

### Project Directory Structure

After creating the project ***my_project***, navigate to the ***my_project*** folder to see the files and directories generated by Anchor:

```bash
my_project/
├── Anchor.toml
├── programs/
│   └── my_program/
│       ├── Cargo.toml
│       ├── src/
│       │   └── lib.rs
│       └── tests/
│           └── program_test.rs
├── target/
└── tests/
    └── integration_test.rs

```

This is a simplified structure that provides a basic framework to start writing, testing, and deploying programs. In a real project, you might need to add other files and directories according to your requirements, such as configuration files and documentation. Here are explanations for some key files and directories:

- **`Anchor.toml`**: The project's configuration file containing basic information, dependencies, and other configuration options.
- **`programs` directory**: Contains the directory for your program. In this example, there's a subdirectory named **`my_program`**.
    - **`Cargo.toml`**: Rust project configuration file for the program.
    - **`src` directory**: Contains the actual program code files, usually **`lib.rs`**. In a real project, you might split it into more modules.
    - **`tests` directory**: Contains test code files for testing the program.
- **`target` directory**: Contains files generated from building and compiling.
- **`tests` directory**: Contains integration test code files for testing the entire project's integration.
